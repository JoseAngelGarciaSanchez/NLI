# Natural Language Inference on SNLI Dataset

This repository contains our work on Natural Language Inference (NLI) using the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Dataset. Our model demonstrates an impressive AUC of 89.3%, which is significantly higher than the hazard level of 33.3%. Although the state of the art currently stands at 93%, our model showcases the potential to bridge the gap and contribute valuable insights to the NLI research community.
